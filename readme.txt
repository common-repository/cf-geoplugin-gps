= On uninstall =

When you choose to uninstall the Geo Controller GPS extension, it's important to be aware that all data associated with the plugin will be permanently deleted from your WordPress installation. This includes the plugin's setup, license, and any other changes that you have made using the plugin. The plugin will clean everything from your database, and this process is irreversible, meaning that you will not be able to retrieve or restore any of the data that was generated by the plugin. So before you proceed with the uninstallation, it's important to make sure that you have a backup of any important data that you want to keep, or you have an alternative way to store the data.

   - Navigate to the API & Services dashboard.
   - Enable the Geocoding API.
   - Navigate to `Credentials` and create a new API key.
   - Restrict the API key to your website's domain for added security.

3. **Installing the GPS Module:**
   - Download the GPS module plugin from the [official repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf-geoplugin-gps/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin free? =

Yes. But you can only use it with a properly licensed version of the Geo Controller. 

= Why must I use Google Map functionality? =

Plugin in the background using Google services to provide proper GPS information.

= Why does the plugin not work on my site? =

There is few reasons:

1. Your Geo Controller license might be invalid or inadequate
2. Your Google Map API Key may be invalid or improperly set up
3. Your Google Account may have restrictions on your domain or not be whitelisted
4. Your site may be hosted on a local computer (localhost)
5. Your visitors might not have GPS enabled or location tracking disabled on their mobile devices.

= Geo Controller GPS extension slows down my site? =

NO, Geo Controller GPS extension uses the asynchronous data reading from API services.

= Why I can't use GPS on the monthly license or limited lookup? =

It is very complicated to get GPS information and this data is sensitive. We must provide secure and unrestricted access to this information and therefore only annual licenses may use this information.

= Does this plugin do visitors tracking? =

No! This plugin cannot be used to track visitors. Plugin only returns some basic geo information and saves to session on the 5 minutes.
